# OhmyrunFrontend

# Project description

Running or jogging out on the streets next to traffic is something that many people do, sometimes because people do not know what trail or place is close by to go and enjoy a run.  Many runners get hit by cars especially in the dark winter. We would like to create a web app that allows runners to find places where they can run safely. The purpose of this app will be to allow runners to save and share information about locations where other people will be able to use. Locations of places will be shared by other runners. We would like to extend this app by creating a community of users interacting to make running  safer.
